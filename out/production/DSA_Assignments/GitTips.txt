Similar to git nah, the git uncommit alias is helpful if you haven't pushed code to a remote repository ,
and you want to remove the commit:

[alias]
    uncommit = reset --soft HEAD~1
This is just a shortcut for 'git reset --soft HEAD~1', which essentially rewinds the branch by one commit
and keeps the changes from that commit in the staging area.
